**Mews.Fiscalizations** is a .NET library that was built to help reporting of e-invoices to different government authorities.

## üìÉ Description

This repository contains multiple projects. Each project supports reporting of e-invoices to the corresponding country's government authority. Each project folder has its own documentation. Use the link in the table below to get there.

**Please note that we're not responsible for how these libraries are used and whether the data provided is correct or not.**
**Also, it is important to note that these libraries were created to meet our usages, so they might be missing some data that can be important in your case (feel free to extend any library and create a PR).**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

For the reporting of e-invoices to a specific authority, install the package that corresponds to that country through NuGet or by using the following commands.

For example, installing the Spanish fiscalization package in order to report invoices to the Spanish authorities (SII).
```bash
Install-Package Mews.Fiscalizations.Spain
```

To install the package that supports reporting e-invoices for all the supported countries.
```bash
Install-Package Mews.Fiscalizations.All
```

## üéØ Features

-   Functional approach via [FuncSharp](https://github.com/MewsSystems/FuncSharp). Definitely check out the examples of usage, so you're not surprised. At the very least IOptions and ITries.
-   Early data validation.
-   Asynchronous I/O.
-   All endpoints are covered with tests.
-   Intuitive immutable DTOs.
-   Pipelines that run on both Windows and Linux operating systems.
-   Code examples for each project.
-   Cross-platform (uses .NET 8).
-   6 countries + Basque region supported.
-   Logging support for some fiscalizations.

## ‚ö† Warning
Since our production servers are now on .NET Core, we no longer need to use ConfigureAwait when awaiting tasks. as .NET Core does not have a SynchronizationContext, so it won't matter if we use ConfigureAwait or not. But if you need to, you may need to create another branch and include this.

## üëÄ Examples

Please visit the desired fiscalization project to see its code examples.
