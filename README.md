**Mews.Fiscalizations** is a .NET library designed to support reporting of e-invoices to government authorities in multiple countries.

## üìÉ Overview

This repository contains a set of projects, each focused on facilitating e-invoice reporting to the appropriate governmental authority in different regions. Refer to the documentation in each project folder for details on specific implementations.

>Disclaimer: These libraries were developed for internal use, so additional customization may be necessary to meet your specific needs. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of data produced by the libraries. Contributions are welcome if you'd like to extend functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To use a fiscalization package for a specific country, install it via NuGet

Here‚Äôs how to get started with the Spanish fiscalization package, for example:
```bash
Install-Package Mews.Fiscalizations.Spain
```

To install the package that covers all supported countries:
```bash
Install-Package Mews.Fiscalizations.All
```

## üéØ Key Features

-   Functional programming approach using [FuncSharp](https://github.com/MewsSystems/FuncSharp). with an emphasis on 'Option' and 'Try'.
-   Early validation of data inputs.
-   Asynchronous I/O operations.
-   Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints.
-   Intuitive and immutable Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
-   CI/CD pipelines compatible with both Windows and Linux.
-   Code examples provided within each project.
-   Cross-platform compatibility (.NET 8).
-   Support for fiscalizations across six countries and the Basque region.
-   Logging capabilities for selected implementations.

## ‚ö† Important Notes
Our production environments run on .NET 8, which doesn‚Äôt require `ConfigureAwait` since there‚Äôs no `SynchronizationContext`. However, if you rely on `ConfigureAwait` in your application, consider creating a separate branch to accommodate this.

## üëÄ Examples

Each fiscalization project includes code examples. Refer to the project-specific documentation for practical implementations and use cases.
