# EET
EET stands for Elektronická Evidence Tržeb, which is Czech version of Fiscal Printers.
It's an online API provided by the Ministry of Finance in a form of a SOAP Web Service.

## Key features
- No Czech abbreviations.
- Early data validation.
- Intuitive immutable DTOs.
- SOAP communication (including WS-Security signing).
- [PKP](doc/data.md) and [BKP](doc/data.md) security code computation.
- Support for parallel async requests.
- Logging support

## Known issues
- [8](https://github.com/MewsSystems/eet/issues/8): As the communication is done fully via HTTPS, we postponed the implementation of response signature verification. It's a potential security risk that will be addressed in upcoming releases.

## Security protocol
- TLS 1.2 protocol must be enabled, that can be achieved by adding the following line to your code:
```csharp
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol |= SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
```

## Usage
We tend to use immutable DTOs wherever possible, especially to ensure data validity.
We want the library to throw an error as soon as possible, i.e. when constructing corresponding data structures.
That is why we even introduce wrappers for simple datatypes.
Various usages are demonstrated in our test cases.

### Simplest usage example
```csharp
var certificate = new Certificate(
    password: "certificatePassword",
    data: certificateContentsByteArray
);

var record = new RevenueRecord(
    identification: new Identification(
        taxPayerIdentifier: new TaxIdentifier("CZ1234567890"),
        registryIdentifier: new RegistryIdentifier("01"),
        premisesIdentifier: new PremisesIdentifier(1),
        certificate: certificate
    ),
    revenue: new Revenue(
        gross: new CurrencyValue(1234.00m)
    ),
    billNumber: new BillNumber("2016-321")
);

var securityCode = record.SecurityCode; // BKP
var signature = record.Signature; // PKP

var client = new EetClient(certificate);
var response = await client.SendRevenueAsync(record);
if (response.IsSuccess)
{
    var fiscalCode = response.Success.FiscalCode;
}
```

# NuGet

We have published the library as [Mews.Fiscalization.Czechia](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mews.Fiscalization.Czechia/).

Alternatively, the NuGet package can be generated by running the following command:

```
src\Mews.Fiscalization.Czechia> nuget pack .\Mews.Fiscalization.Czechia.csproj -IncludeReferencedProjects
```

# Tests
Test are not currently running on Travis CI, as their network infrastructure is blocking HTTPS traffic directed into Europe, where the EET servers are located.

Otherwise, a xUnit test suite is a part of the library, it contains end-to-end tests that communicates with Playground EET servers to verify the lib is really working against the current EET version.
