# SII
SII stands for Suministro Inmediato de Informaci√≥n del IVA, which translates to Immediate Supply of Information on VAT.
It's an online API provided by Spanish authorities in a form of a SOAP Web Service.

## Key features
- No SPanish abbreviations.
- Early data validation.
- Intuitive immutable DTOs.

## Known issues
- We didn't implement deleting or modifying already existing records.

## Usage
We tend to use immutable DTOs wherever possible, especially to ensure data validity.
We want the library to throw an error as soon as possible, i.e. when constructing corresponding data structures.
That is why we even introduce wrappers for simple datatypes.
